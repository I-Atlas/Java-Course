# Java-Course

Java level 1

# My opinion about a cource

### Minuses:
* There is no mentor on the course;
* Grading system (tasks are checked **very slowly**);
* Submission of material (the teacher often shows the non-optimal structure of the project);
* Some homework is not relevant to the topic of the lesson;

### Pluses:
* I liked 2 of 7 tasks, but these was not checked.
